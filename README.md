# Example for pi pico w in circuitpython

In this repository I am pushing code I have fidgeted with and got it to work. So far there is code for:

1. A simple blinking LED
2. A boot.py for allowing file creation on the pico's program memmory
3. Writing and reading files from the program memmory
4. Logging the CPU temperature in a local file
5. Logging the CPI temperature to influxDB cloud using their API credentials with a post request
6. UART communication
